<h1>Market Test Template</h1>
<h2>What it is?</h2>
<p>
  This Laravel based template serves as a starting point to test website ideas. This was inspired by The Lean Startup by Eric Ries and is a part of a market test process I am developing here <a href="https://myofficeitperson.com/posts/test-a-business-idea-process">https://myofficeitperson.com/posts/test-a-business-idea-process</a>.
</p>
<h2>What you can do with it?
</h2>
<p>Install this repository and have all of the boilerplate lead acquisition stuff done. Add your analytics script, build the design and copy for a lead funnel, and start running traffic at it.
If your goal is to test a value proposition, pricing and track everything using Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics. This install may serve you.
</p>
<h2>Features
</h2>
<p>
  This install has components in place to collect leads, calculate pricing, capture contact messages, and create blog posts.
